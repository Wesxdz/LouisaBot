# LouisaBot
A helpful chatbot with NLP and speech synthesis. Knowledge and commands can be taught and resemble a conversation.
Louisa is programed to work primarily on Mac OS X, I will eventually port to Windows.

The project is still in early stages, <b>it's mainly an experiment in expressive and animated voice sythesis.<b>
